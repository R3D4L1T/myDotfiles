# My Dotfiles

## Nvim

Neovim is the best code editor for me. Neovim has everything that makes coding fun for meâ€”keybindings and minimalism from all angles.

However, I don't know how to create beautiful interfaces. I based my configurations on other developers' setups. For this repository, I drew inspiration from:

- [Gentleman Programming Dotfiles](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/Gentleman.Dots)
- [Craftzdog Dotfiles](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public/tree/master)

A big thanks to these configurations for helping me as a new user.

For this reason, I saved these configurations here. If you need a reference or want to learn how to use them, feel free to explore. Note that these configurations are adapted for my personal use.
