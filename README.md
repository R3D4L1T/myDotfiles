# My Dotfiles


## Nvim

Neovim is the best code editor for me. Neovim has everything that makes coding fun for meâ€”keybindings and minimalism from all angles.

However, I don't know how to create beautiful interfaces. I based my configurations on other developers' setups. For this repository, I drew inspiration from:

- [Gentleman Programming Dotfiles](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/Gentleman.Dots)
- [Craftzdog Dotfiles](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public/tree/master)

A big thanks to these configurations for helping me as a new user.

For this reason, I saved these configurations here. If you need a reference or want to learn how to use them, feel free to explore. Note that these configurations are adapted for my personal use.

## Obsidian
 My Obsidian vault is inspired by the beautiful organization and custom tools from [CreArts-Obsidian-Vault](https://github.com/CreArts-Community/CreArts-Obsidian-Vault). This includes integrations for Google Notes, ChatGPT, and a well-structured note organization system.                                    

 I adapted these configurations for my personal use, focusing on productivity and aesthetics. If you'd like to explore or learn how to use these setups, feel free to check out the repository. Note that my configurations are tailored to my workflow.
